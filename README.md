# Semi Supervised GAN (10+1 class)

Tensorflow implementation for Semi Supervised using GAN


Train the model with improved GAN:

    $ python train_cifar_feature_matching_tf.py

or ALI. 

    $ python train_cifar_feature_matching_ali_tf.py


Reference:
The implementation is heavily based on the Theano code:
